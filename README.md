# Pulse

Pulse is an extension for [pyDimension][pyDimension] that runs a very basic web stats engine.

Getting it running without pyDimension is entirely possible, however, it will need a bit of tweaking to get rid of the configuration references in `database.py` and the import and use of the `login_required` decorator.
